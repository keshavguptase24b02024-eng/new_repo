    You are an expert environmental scientist specializing in groundwater contamination.
    Analyze the following heavy metal pollution data and provide a concise, actionable report.
    The data includes calculated indices: HPI (Heavy Metal Pollution Index), HEI (Heavy Metal Evaluation Index), and Cd (Contamination Index).
    
    Data:
    ${JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}

    Based on the data, please provide the following in your report:
    1.  **Overall Summary:** A brief overview of the water quality across all samples.
    2.  **Hotspot Identification:** Identify the sample locations (by ID and coordinates) with the highest pollution levels for each index (HPI, HEI, Cd).
    3.  **Key Pollutants:** Determine which heavy metals are the most significant contributors to the pollution across the dataset.
    4.  **Potential Risks & Sources:** Briefly mention the potential health risks associated with the key pollutants and suggest likely anthropogenic or natural sources.
    5.  **Recommendations:** Provide clear, actionable recommendations for further investigation, monitoring, and potential remediation.

    Format the response in clear, well-structured markdown.
